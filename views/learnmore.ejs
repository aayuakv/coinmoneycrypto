  <h3>A Brief History of Cryptocurrency</h3>
  <p>In the caveman era, people used the barter system, in which goods and services are exchanged among two or
     more people. For instance, someone might exchange seven apples for seven oranges. The barter system fell out
      of popular use because it had some glaring flaws:<br>

  <ul>
    <li>People’s requirements have to coincide—if you have something to trade, someone else has to want it, and you have
   to want what the other person is offering. <br>
  <li>There’s no common measure of value—you have to decide how many of your items you are willing to trade for other
  items, and not all items can be divided. For example, you cannot divide a live animal into smaller units. <br>
  <li>The goods cannot be transported easily, unlike our modern currency, which fits in a wallet or is stored on a mobile
   phone.
  </ul>
   <br>
  After people realized the barter system didn’t work very well, the currency went through a few iterations: In 110
  B.C., an official currency was minted; in A.D. 1250, gold-plated florins were introduced and used across Europe;
  and from 1600 to 1900, the paper currency gained widespread popularity and ended up being used around the world.
  This is how modern currency as we know it came into existence.
  <br><br>

  Modern currency includes paper currency, coins, credit cards, and digital wallets—for example, Apple Pay, Amazon
  Pay, Paytm, PayPal, and so on. All of it is controlled by banks and governments, meaning that there is a centralized
   regulatory authority that limits how paper currency and credit cards work.</p>

    <h3>Traditional Currencies vs Cryptocurrencies</h3>
    <p>Imagine a scenario in which you want to repay a friend who bought you lunch, by sending money online to his or
       her account. There are several ways in which this could go wrong, including:<br><br></p>
  <ul>
  <li>The financial institution could have a technical issue, such as its systems are down or the machines aren’t working
    properly.<br><br>
  <li>Your or your friend’s account could have been hacked—for example, there could be a denial-of-service attack or
    identity theft. <br><br>
  <li>The transfer limits for your or your friend’s account could have been exceeded. <br><br>
  </ul>
  <p>
  There is a central point of failure: the bank.<br><br>

  This is why the future of currency lies with cryptocurrency. Now imagine a similar transaction between two people
  using the bitcoin app. A notification appears asking whether the person is sure he or she is ready to transfer
  bitcoins. If yes, processing takes place: The system authenticates the user’s identity, checks whether the user has
   the required balance to make that transaction, and so on. After that’s done, the payment is transferred and the money
    lands in the receiver’s account. All of this happens in a matter of minutes. <br><br>

  Cryptocurrency, then, removes all the problems of modern banking: There are no limits to the funds you can transfer,
   your accounts cannot be hacked, and there is no central point of failure. As mentioned above, as of 2018 there are more
    than 1,600 cryptocurrencies available; some popular ones are Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Zcash. And a new
    cryptocurrency crops up every single day. Considering how much growth they’re experiencing at the moment,
    there’s a good chance that there are plenty more to come!</p>

  <h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
  <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography,
     which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies
     are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced
      by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they
       are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to
        government interference or manipulation.</p><br><br>
      <h5>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a
          large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control
          of governments and central authorities.<br><br>
        <li>The word “cryptocurrency” is derived from the encryption techniques which are used to secure
            the network.<br><br>
        <li>Blockchains, which are organizational methods for ensuring the integrity of transactional data,
             are an essential component of many cryptocurrencies.<br><br>
        <li>Many experts believe that blockchain and related technology will disrupt many industries,
          including finance and law.<br><br>
        <li> Cryptocurrencies face criticism for a number of reasons, including their use for illegal activities,
          exchange rate volatility, and vulnerabilities of the infrastructure underlying them. However, they also
          have been praised for their portability, divisibility, inflation resistance, and transparency.<br><br>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding Cryptocurrencies</h3>
      <p>Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in terms of
        virtual "tokens," which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system. "Crypto" refers to the
        various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical
        curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.</p><br><br>
      <h3>Types of Cryptocurrencies</h3><br><br>
      <p>The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable.
         Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications.
         Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch.
         <br><br>

       Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto". As of March 2021,
        there were over 18.6 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $927 billion.<br><br>


       Some of the competing cryptocurrencies spawned by Bitcoin’s success, known as "altcoins," include Litecoin, Peercoin,
        and Namecoin, as well as Ethereum, Cardano, and EOS. Today, the aggregate value of all the cryptocurrencies in
         existence is around $1.5 trillion—Bitcoin currently represents more than 60% of the total value.</p>

           <h3>Cryptography in Bitcoin Transactions</h3>
           <p>In a normal bitcoin transaction, first, there are the transaction details: whom you want to send the bitcoins
             to and how many bitcoins you want to send. Then the information is passed through a hashing algorithm. Bitcoin,
             as mentioned, uses the SHA-256 algorithm. The output is then passed through a signature algorithm with the
             user’s private key, used to uniquely identify the user. The digitally signed output is then distributed across
              the network for other users to verify. This is done by using the sender’s public key.<br><br>

         The users who check the transaction to see whether it’s valid or not are known as miners. After this is done,
         the transaction and several others are added to the blockchain, where the details cannot be changed.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="section-6" >
  <h3>Benefits of Cryptocurrency</h3>
  <p>With cryptocurrency, the transaction cost is low to nothing at all—unlike, for example, the fee for transferring
     money from a digital wallet to a bank account. You can make transactions at any time of the day or night, and
     there are no limits on purchases and withdrawals. And anyone is free to use cryptocurrency, unlike setting up
      a bank account, which requires documentation and other paperwork.<br><br>

  International cryptocurrency transactions are faster than wire transfers too. Wire transfers take about half a day
   for the money to be moved from one place to another. With cryptocurrencies, transactions take only a matter of
   minutes or even seconds.</p>

      <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency</h3>
      <h5>Advantages</h5>
      <p>Cryptocurrencies hold the promise of making it easier to transfer funds directly between two parties, without
        the need for a trusted third party like a bank or credit card company. These transfers are instead secured by
         the use of public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, like Proof of Work or Proof
         of Stake.<br><br>

       In modern cryptocurrency systems, a user's "wallet," or account address, has a public key, while the private key
       is known only to the owner and is used to sign transactions. Fund transfers are completed with minimal processing
        fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by banks and financial institutions for wire transfers.</p>
  <br><br>
       <h5>Disadvantages </h5>
       <p>The semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes them well-suited for a host of illegal activities,
          such as money laundering and tax evasion. However, cryptocurrency advocates often highly value their anonymity,
          citing benefits of privacy like protection for whistleblowers or activists living under repressive governments.
          Some cryptocurrencies are more private than others.<br><br>

       Bitcoin, for instance, is a relatively poor choice for conducting illegal business online, since the forensic
        analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain has helped authorities arrest and prosecute criminals. More privacy-oriented
        coins do exist, however, such as Dash, Monero, or ZCash, which are far more difficult to trace.</p><br><br>
  </section>
  <section id="section-8" >
        <h3>The Future of Cryptocurrency</h3>
        <p>The world is clearly divided when it comes to cryptocurrencies. On one side are supporters such as Bill Gates,
           Al Gore and Richard Branson, who say that cryptocurrencies are better than regular currencies. On the other side
           are people such as Warren Buffet, Paul Krugman, and Robert Shiller, who are against it. Krugman and Shiller, who
            are both Nobel Prize winners in the field of economics, call it a Ponzi scheme and a means for criminal
            activities.
  <br><br>
        In the future, there’s going to be a conflict between regulation and anonymity. Since several cryptocurrencies
        have been linked with terrorist attacks, governments would want to regulate how cryptocurrencies work. On the
        other hand, the main emphasis of cryptocurrencies is to ensure that users remain anonymous.
  <br><br>
        Futurists believe that by the year 2030, cryptocurrencies will occupy 25 percent of national currencies, which
         means a significant chunk of the world would start believing in cryptocurrency as a mode of transaction.
         It’s going to be increasingly accepted by merchants and customers, and it will continue to have a volatile
         nature, which means prices will continue to fluctuate, as they have been doing for the past few years.
